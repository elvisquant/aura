Aura is not just a project; it's an architectural opinion. It demonstrates a holistic approach to DevSecOps, where security, infrastructure, and automation are treated as integral components of the software development lifecycle, not afterthoughts. This repository serves as a live, working example of how to build a resilient, scalable, and secure platform from the ground up using industry-best practices.

### üèõÔ∏è Architectural Blueprint

At its core, Aura automates the entire journey from a `git push` to a monitored, production-ready application. The architecture is designed for security, resilience, and full observability.

‚ú® Core Features

    100% Infrastructure as Code (IaC): The entire AWS infrastructure is defined declaratively using Terraform, enabling automated, repeatable, and version-controlled environments.

    Secure by Design: Adheres to a zero-trust model with fine-grained IAM roles, network segmentation via a custom VPC, encrypted data at rest and in transit, and secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager.

    End-to-End DevSecOps Pipeline: Leverages GitHub Actions for a full CI/CD workflow, including Static Application Security Testing (SonarQube) and container vulnerability scanning (Trivy) to shift security left.

    Scalable Container Orchestration: Deploys applications to a high-availability Amazon EKS cluster, managed with declarative configurations using Helm.

    Managed & Resilient Database: Utilizes Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL in isolated subnets for a secure, durable, and managed database solution.

    Deep Observability: Implements a robust monitoring stack with Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization and alerting.

    One-Command Lifecycle: Employs a Makefile as a clean interface to abstract away complexity. make deploy builds everything; make destroy tears it all down.

üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository's structure is a deliberate architectural choice designed to enforce a strict separation of concerns. This philosophy ensures the project is maintainable, scalable, and intuitive.

Architectural Justification

    app/ vs. infrastructure/: The most critical separation. Developers can work on the application in the app directory without needing to understand the complexities of the Terraform code in infrastructure. This decoupling is key to team velocity and specialization.

    infrastructure/ vs. kubernetes/: Provisioning the EKS cluster (infrastructure) is a separate concern from deploying an application to it (kubernetes). This allows us to update our application's Helm chart and redeploy it without ever touching the underlying infrastructure code.

    infrastructure/modules/: We do not write monolithic Terraform code. By breaking our infrastructure into reusable modules (like vpc, eks, rds), we create building blocks that are easier to test, maintain, and reuse across different environments. This is a hallmark of professional IaC.

    Makefile: This file acts as a clean abstraction layer. Instead of forcing a user to remember long terraform or kubectl commands, we provide a simple, unified interface (make deploy, make destroy). This makes the project accessible and reduces the chance of human error.
